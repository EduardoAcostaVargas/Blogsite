        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
        Welcome to our platform! 
        This website is built with a focus on simplicity, usability, and flexibility, providing a smooth experience for creating, browsing, and interacting with blog content.
         Below is an overview of the core technologies and features that power this site.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="home-section">
        <h2>Backend Framework</h2>
        <p>
        Our site uses a Flask backend, responsible for handling routing, rendering templates, and connecting all application logic. 
        Flask's lightweight design makes it ideal for building scalable and efficient web applications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="home-section">
        <h2>Dynamic Templating with Jinja2</h2>
        <p>
        All HTML pages are rendered using Jinja2 templates, enabling dynamic content, reusable layouts, and clean separation between logic and presentation. 
        This ensures pages load efficiently and stay consistent throughout the site.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="home-section">
        <h2>Website Navigation and Routing</h2>
        <p>
        We provide intuitive navigation across all pages, supported by Flask routes that connect users to:
        </p>
